	1. lu_ routines cannot return a build error unless all of the
	   get next's have been tried!  (means ugly goto's)

DONE	2. buffer allocation and mem allocation for string variables!
	  	NOT NEEDED WITH #8.

DONE	3. next on non-existant variable does not seem to work.

DONE	4. free memory after updating tree with same variable
		(agent snmp stuff)

DONE	5. When given an variable with no instance (agent var and others?),
	   finds the next instead of (0.0.0.0), because instptr is
	   not NULL, but should be.

DONE	6. syslog messages by find_ifnet_bynum(), why? does not seem 
	   affect anything.

DONE	7. finish up debug.c  in printing of response packet (some types
	   left out).

DONE	8. free memory after creating string value in response.

DONE	9. Makefile should have a make depend.

DONE	10. keywords in conf file need to use the new-speak.

DONE	11. zero cruft at the end of query's and get next's

DONE	12. When an error is generated, send back the same packet
	    in certain cases. With an error status set.

DONE	13. Check SIGNAL masking.  May be masked wrong.

DONE	14. Make routing tables in order.  When responding.

DONE	15. conformance to sets.

DONE	16. Update Man page.

DONE	17. print out trap messages in debug.c

DONE	18. comment up the code and clean up header files.

DONE	19. if_grp problem when query'ing for interface 0, it works.
	    WRONG!  should return an error.  also, look in find_ifnet_by*.

DONE	20. Clean up sets.

DONE	21. Add host route table support.

DONE	22. TCP conn table support.

DONE	23. ARP table support.

DONE	24. Make final RFC MIB/SMI changes as postel stated.
